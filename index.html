        Another winter storm coming our way that could dump 5 more inches of snow. If you are experiencing power loss, I
        really hope your power is restored soon. If you have power, invite friends, family, & neighbors in who don't. Check on
        others! If you have food or can run to grocery stores, please help others.
        I know some people don't have power at all, if there is anything I can do to help you, reach out to me.<br>
        <br>
        If you don't have power and need to charge your devices, check out your local coffee shops.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>
        Stay Safe and Warm<br> Enjoy the snow!
